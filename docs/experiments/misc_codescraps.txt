I didn't think to try this before, but after reading another issue with wine_mono_trace & https://wiki.winehq.org/Mono#Debugging, I tried `WINE_MONO_TRACE=M:nsoftware.Sys.Internal.Public.SystemIPHlpAPI:GetAdapterInfo MONO_VERBOSE_METHOD=GetAdapterInfo` on the `at nsoftware.Sys.Internal.Public.SystemIPHlpAPI.GetAdapterInfo` part of the exception type stack trace and got this:

Do we need `sudo apt-get install p7zip-full -y`? or can we just use cabextract?
























If we create a wineprefix on a linux computer, then install dotnet35sp1, vcrun2015, and all our other Windows drivers and things there, we can then just copy our wineprefix over to our Pi to install the rest of our software there.  The Windows DLL files are not legally sharable, so I can't supply anyone with my already-made wineprefix from my Linux VMWare box, but I've written up steps for how to make one.  The whole process takes about an hour and a half I think:

VMWare Workstation Player for Windows:
https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html

Debian 10 Image
https://www.debian.org/distrib/
https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/debian-10.6.0-i386-netinst.iso

Install OS (I set up username: pi , pass: raspberry), boot, open terminal:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop -y
#I would also go to "Settings>Power" and set "Blank Screen" to "Never" and "Automatic Suspend" to "Off"
#Power off Debian 10 from inside VMWare, then boot up the Debian 10 image again.  You can now copy-paste from Windows into Debian 10 terminal.

sudo apt-get upgrade -y
wget -O - https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/debian/ buster main'
sudo apt-get update

#Wine 4.5+ needs libfaudio0 before wine-staging will install, otherwise it will tell you about missing dependencies
wget https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/Debian_10/Release.key
sudo apt-key add Release.key
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/Debian_10/ ./'
sudo apt install libfaudio0 -y
#Old method (I didn't test the above libfaudio0 install steps, but they should be better than this method)
#cd ~/Downloads
#wget -nc https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/Debian_10/i386/libfaudio0_20.01-0~buster_i386.deb
#sudo apt install ./libfaudio0_20.01-0~buster_i386.deb -y

# Wine 5.13 comes with TwisterOS, so we'll use that version
sudo apt-get install --install-recommends wine-staging-i386=5.13~buster -y
sudo apt-get install --install-recommends wine-staging=5.13~buster -y
sudo apt-get install --install-recommends winehq-staging=5.13~buster -y
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks
chmod +x winetricks
sudo mv -v winetricks /usr/local/bin
sudo apt-get install cabextract -y # needed for winetricks to work
sudo apt-get install winbind -y # And accept the user prompt: "yes"

# Make a new wineprefix and install all the components we want
wine wineboot # Don't need to install mono, go ahead and install Gecko
winetricks -q corefonts dotnet35sp1 vb6run vcrun2015 sound=alsa win7

# Install official Windows NT 4.0 pdh.dll for VARA (the pdh.dll that "winetricks pdh" installs is too new for VARA)
sudo apt-get install zip -y
cd ~/Downloads && mkdir pdhNT40 && cd pdhNT40
wget http://download.microsoft.com/download/winntsrv40/update/5.0.2195.2668/nt4/en-us/nt4pdhdll.exe
unzip -o nt4pdhdll.exe
cp pdh.dll ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32

cd ~/Downloads
tar -cvf winebottle.tar ~/.wine # copy the wineprefix into a tar file (to preserve simlinks when we copy the wineprefix to a USB drive)
```

Plug in a USB drive on your Windows computer, go to VMWare Workstation > Player > Removable Devices and then connect your USB drive to your VMWare Debian computer.
Now copy the tar file onto a USB drive, open Debian's file explorer to eject the USB drive, then unplug the drive from your Windows machine.
Put the USB drive into your Pi, and untar its contents (the .wine folder) into your Pi's `~/` directory with `tar -xvf winebottle.tar -C ~/`

You can now install your Windows apps into this wineprefix on the Pi
